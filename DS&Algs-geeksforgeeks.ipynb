    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Dictionary `dict()`:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Tuple `tuple()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are collections of Python objects much like lists but *immutable* in nature, i.e., the elements cannot be added or removed once created.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sets `set()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are unordered collections of data that are mutable and do not allow any duplicate element. Sets are basically used to *include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries*. The data structure used in this is *Hashing*, a popular technique to perform insertion, deletion and traversal in $O(1)$ on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Frozen Sets `frozenset()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Frozen sets are immutable objects that only support methods and operators that produce a result without affecting the frozen set or sets to which they are applied. \n",
    "\n",
    "* String `str()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is an immutable array of characters. Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: As strings are immutable, modifying a string will result in creating a new copy."
